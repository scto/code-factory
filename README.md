# Code Factory
Write your tests, and let AI generate the code.

If changes are needed, simply update the tests, and AI will regenerate the code to meet the new requirements.

## Setup

1. Create a `local.properties` file and add the following.
```
API_KEY="sk-proj-mSwcp..."
```
2. Kotlin (KTS)
```
plugins {
    id("com.google.devtools.ksp") version "1.9.0-1.0.12"
}
``` 
3. Add dependencies
dependencies {
    ksp("com.github.skydoves:sealedx-processor:0.0.2")
}

## Contributions Welcome! 
We're looking for skilled contributors, especially those with expertise in AI and Kotlin. Join us in enhancing Code Factory's capabilities!
